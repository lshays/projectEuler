# This problem was solved using a simple combination equation
# The equation is of the form: C = n!/(n-k)!k!
# In this situation n = 40, and k = 20

# I simply input this into a calculator to find the answer
# Coding it would be trivial

# The logic underneathe is that you basically have 40 choices
# to make. 20 must be left and 20 must be right. Therefore,
# finding all combinations of choosing left 20 times is
# synonomous with finding the different combinations of choosing right.
